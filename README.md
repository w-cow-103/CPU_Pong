# CPU_Pong
The Classic Game of Pong made for the Unity Game Engine. The Twist being the game is between two computer players and was designed to be used as a desktop background using the Wall Paper Engine on Steam. I use this as my desktop wallpaper on my computer and it just has the two computer players going back and forth with a new game starting up the second one CPU wins.

I created the normal game of pong back in High school for a project where humans controlled the two players, but this summer I decided to modify the code so the CPU controlled itself and would play to win.
